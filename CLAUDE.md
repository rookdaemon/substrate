* Always start with identifying the 'smallest valuable increment'.
* Always strive for simplicity and legibility. If solving a problem right means stepping back and refactor first, then do that.
* Always work TDD: red/green/refactor.
* Always leave the code in a better state than when you started.
* Always abstract away environment operations like file, process, time so tests can mock them.
* Always inject timestamps into function calls so tests can excercise with known values.
